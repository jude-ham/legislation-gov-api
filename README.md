I couldn't find any other programs or datasets to download legislation in bulk, so I decided to make one myself!
Also didn't help that there was not much easily accessible information about the existing legislation.gov.uk API, so I had to email the National Archives team that managed it to get sent the link to the documentation (found at the bottom)
